      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>My interests lie at the intersection of data analysis, sustainability, and technology. I’m passionate about leveraging data-driven insights to address complex challenges, especially in the fields of environmental impact and public policy. With experience in ESG analysis, machine learning, and web development, I thrive on projects that combine technical rigor with meaningful real-world applications. Currently, I'm involved in building solutions that help companies understand and mitigate their carbon footprints, while also pursuing advanced studies in data science. I’m eager to connect with opportunities that push the boundaries of responsible innovation.</p>
      
      <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
      <p>I'm working on developing and optimizing machine learning models that analyze environmental, social, and governance (ESG) data to derive meaningful insights. This involves collaborating with cross-functional teams to create AI-driven solutions that assist decision-makers in tackling sustainability challenges.</p>
      <p>I am passionate about machine learning as a tool for discovery, insight, and innovation. With a foundation in computer science and practical experience in both research and startups, I love diving into complex datasets to unlock patterns and build predictive models. My recent projects include analyzing sustainability reports using NLP techniques and designing emissions calculators, both of which rely heavily on machine learning algorithms. I am particularly interested in applying ML to environmental challenges, as I believe technology can play a crucial role in shaping a sustainable future.</p>

      <h2>International Politics</h2>
      <p>My interests lie in international politics, with a focus on European and global governance. I’m fascinated by how political institutions adapt in times of change and crisis, and how policy decisions impact not just nations but entire regions. My studies in International and European Politics, alongside my work with the Federation Global Initiative on Psychiatry <a href="https://gip-usa.org/" target="_blank">(FGIP)</a>, have given me deep insights into both theoretical and practical aspects of governance, diplomacy, and international collaboration. I’m particularly interested in the interplay between politics and technology, and how emerging challenges like cybersecurity and sustainability shape international relations in the 21st century. </p>
